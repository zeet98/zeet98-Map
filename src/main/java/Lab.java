/**
 * Maps are key/value pairs. They are used in situations where we have some value that we'd like
 * to efficiently be able to access, but can be easily identified by some other value.
 * For instance, a dictionary 'key' may be the word and the 'value' may be its definition.
 * Or, if we'd like to keep track of how many times words were used in a book, we could use a word as a 'key'
 * and the amount of times the word appeared as a 'value'.
 *
 * Keys may not be duplicates, but there may be duplicate values in a map.
 *
 * You can read more about HashMap, a very efficient implementation of Map, here:
 * https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_hashmap.asp
